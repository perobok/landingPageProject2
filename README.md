# Landing Page Project


Project 2 - Landing page; Student: Pero Bokic II Submission

Dear Mentor, 

I made corrections you required. 

Unfortunatlly I didn't understand at first that sections and menu items both needs to be highlighted during scrolling. Now it is fixed. 

When you said that page needs to be optimised for all devices, did you mean just to add media brakepoint and fit boxes in to the screen or something more complex like making toggle menu bar? 

I'll try to explain what I did in this project to meet all criteria from project rubric.

First I added script file inside html document and included the, app.js. 

I defined some of global variables at the top. 

After that I started building navigation by changing dimesnions and style to the nav container. 

I created an array of section titles with qeurySellectorAll, and after that created for loop so I can go trough every possible section on page. 

Then I wanted to create function to hide navManu after 7 seconds. This starts on line 65 in app.js. I added as well eventListener for scroll so nav can show again if page is scrolled down or up. 

At the end I created a button. Button is created in HTML code and will show only after we reach last section. 

Thank you

Pero Bokic
